## About
This is the second full stack app I completed for my Bloc.io course. The course taught us to build a bookmarks app step by step: [Bookmarks Client Repo](https://github.com/bix6/bookmarks-app) and [Bookmarks API Repo](https://github.com/bix6/bookmarks-server). Then the assignments had us create a similar app (Noteful) to practice and solidify our learning on our own.
